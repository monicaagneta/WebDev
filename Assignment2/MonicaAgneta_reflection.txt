Before this assignment I had not done much frontend web design at all so while building this travel site I became more familiar with HTML and CSS. Between the two it is clear how the content is sectioned and how to refer to the HTML in CSS but the thing that was challenging was knowing how to translate the style and look I wanted into CSS. I realized it takes a lot of CSS code for a webpage to look presentable, as well as how I had to use many different CSS resources for things such as patterns, fonts, colors, and boxes. Next time I think I will focus on all of the HTML before I style it with CSS.
