The purpose of this website is to be a personal portfolio of books I have read since reading is something I enjoy. I thought it would be cool to showcase books I have read as a digital library. The admin view of my library allows me to add books with simple UI, and shows the books on a "bookshelf". I then have an about the reader page, so that people viewing the library can get to know me better. There is also a separate page for users to view my library without the ability to add books, so that they have a different view of my libary with my reading statistics.
